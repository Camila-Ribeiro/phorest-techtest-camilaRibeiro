## Problem Description
Phorest has a platform for our customers to build their own applications on.

You are tasked with building an interface to our platform. UI (web or app) or CLI application.

The test is split into two parts. First is search for clients and the second is creating vouchers. Do
your best and see how far you get without stressing yourself too much.

Our API documentation can be found [here](https://api-gateway-dev.phorest.com/third-party-api-server/swagger-ui.html) . Itâ€™s a REST API and uses JSON. Please get in touch if
you have troubles making requests to the API.
here

We are looking for a web application, native app or command line interface - to our API.


## Acceptance Criteria

### For Step 1
You should be able to handle when there are many of the same clients returned (with the same
number or email). So if there are two clients returned for the same phone number, display both.

### For Step 2
The UI should let you input the amount you want to create the voucher for, and then display the
voucher has been created successfully.

This is about solving the problem, we have seen people use Vanilla javascript, React, iOS, Android,
Vue and others. You should look to use libraries and frameworks to do the heavy lifting if you are
comfortable with them, but use the tools you best know and can work with.

### Bonus Points
- Automated tests
- Nice UI
- Clean code
- Deploy code / give instructions on how to set up environments

## Testing
Automated were conducted in this project test. 

### Automated Testing
I used [Jasmine 3.5.0](https://jasmine.github.io/) in conjunction with [jasmine-jquery 2.1.1](https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery) to build all automated tests (test-driven development). These tests can be found in the [testing/automated(../blob/master/Testing.md) folder.

There are **12** tests in my specs, all successfully passing, with **0** failures.

## Deployment

My [Phorest Tech Test](https://github.com/Camila-Ribeiro/phorest-techtest-camilaRibeiro) was developed locally using **VS Code**, and all commits were pushed to **GitHub** using **Git**.

This website was deployed on GitHub pages built from the Master branch to publish the test.
To run this project locally, download the files and navigate through the index.html to start.

### Local Deployment

To run this project locally on your own system, you will need to clone this repository and need to have [GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) installed and any suitable IDE.

Next, to proceed with local deployment, you can...

- **Download** this GitHub repository
    - by "*Code*" button above (beside green Gitpod button),
    - select *Download Zip*, this will download the project as a zip-file (*remember to unzip it first*).

### Remote Deployment

This site was deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the **master branch**.

Deployed Site:
- [https://github.com/Camila-Ribeiro/phorest-techtest-camilaRibeiro](https://github.com/Camila-Ribeiro/phorest-techtest-camilaRibeiro)

Once you have the project setup locally, you can proceed to deploy it remotely with the following steps:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository:
    - `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO`
2. Click on the **Settings** tab at the top:
    - `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/settings`
3. Scroll down on that page to the **GitHub Pages** section.
4. The first drop-down field should be **Source** with *None* preselected.
5. Select **master branch** from the list.
6. The page should refresh.
7. Scroll back down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
8. You should now have a deployed link:
    - `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO`

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:
- Please allow a few minutes to pass before opening your newly deployed link! Clicking this link too quickly may result in a failure to build the site, causing an Error 404 page instead.

Congratulations! Your project should be deployed successfully on GitHub Pages! :tada:

## Environment Variables
Steps to set up environmets:

1. Create `config.js` file inside `js` folder,
2. Add `<script src="assets/js/config.js"></script>` on index.html,
3. Add `config.js` file to `.gitignore` file using path `assets/js/config.js`,
4. On `config.js` file add desired variables as per example below:
    ```
    var env = {
        url  : "",
        username : "",
        password  : ""
    };
    ```
5. On `main.js` file pass the varibles as per example below:
     ```
    let url = env.url;
    let username = env.username;
    let password = env.password;
    ```
6.  Create `config_sample.js` file inside `js` folder and rename this file to `config.js` when running it locally in order to work sucessfully (Do not add this file to `.gitignore`)
